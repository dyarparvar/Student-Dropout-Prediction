# Student-Dropout-Prediction
Neural Networks / XGBoost

We aim to help the stakeholder anticipate student dropout by developing a predictive model. The insights will support them in identifying key metrics to monitor and enabling timely interventions to retain more students. This, in turn, helps reduce the risk of financial instability, revenue loss, reputational damage, and student dissatisfaction.
